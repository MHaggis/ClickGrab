  A sophisticated ClickFix variant that impersonates Google Meet video conferencing.
  The phishing page displays a fake "Can't join the meeting" error and instructs
  users to press Win+R, then Ctrl+V, then Enter to execute a malicious command
  that was silently copied to their clipboard. This technique was documented by
  Push Security as "the most advanced ClickFix yet" in November 2025.

  According to Microsoft's 2025 Digital Defense Report, ClickFix accounted for
  47% of initial access methods in the past year.

      The fake Google Meet page shows a realistic video conferencing interface
      with a popup stating "Can't join the meeting" and instructions to execute
      a command via Win+R. The malicious command is automatically copied to the

      - "Instructions say: Press Win+R, then Ctrl+V, then Enter"
      - "Malicious PowerShell command was silently copied to clipboard"
      - "User unknowingly executes malware"
